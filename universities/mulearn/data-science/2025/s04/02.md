# END TO END ML MODEL-deployment


## Task Objectives

* *Enhance practical ML skills* by creating a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline.
* *Develop technical expertise* in data preprocessing, model training, API development, and deployment.
* *Promote real-world problem-solving skills* through hands-on implementation and deployment of ML models.
* *Strengthen software engineering practices* by applying containerization and reproducibility techniques.
* *Improve communication and documentation skills* for sharing model usage and deployment details.

## Course Outcomes

* *CO1:* Select and define a suitable dataset and objective for model training.
* *CO2:* Build and evaluate a machine learning pipeline using tools like scikit-learn, pandas, and joblib.
* *CO3:* Create and test an inference API using FastAPI or Flask.
* *CO4:* Containerize the application with Docker for consistent deployment.
* *CO5:* Deploy the model online using platforms like Render, Railway, or Hugging Face Spaces.
* *CO6:* Share both the GitHub repository and the live deployment link for public access.

## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Dataset Selection & Objective Definition
* Choose a dataset relevant to a real-world problem (e.g., spam detection, product rating prediction).
* Clearly define the model’s objective and evaluation metrics.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.

### Module 2: Building the Data Pipeline
* Preprocess the dataset (handle missing data, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features).
* Train a suitable ML model.
* Evaluate the model’s performance using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).
* Save the trained model and preprocessing pipeline using **joblib**.

### Module 3: API Development
* Write an inference script to load the saved model and return predictions.
* Implement an API using **FastAPI** or **Flask**.
* Test the API locally to ensure correct functionality.

### Module 4: Containerization
* Create a **Dockerfile** to package the application, model, and dependencies.
* Build and run the Docker container locally for testing.

### Module 5: Deployment
* Deploy the containerized application using one of the following:
  * **Render**
  * **Railway**
  * **Hugging Face Spaces**
* Ensure the API endpoint is publicly accessible.
* Test the live API using **curl** or **Postman**.

### Module 6: Documentation & Submission
* Document the following in the GitHub repository:
  * How to run the application locally.
  * How to access the deployed API.
  * Example API requests and responses.
* Share both for submission:
  1. **GitHub Repository URL**
  2. **Live Deployment Link**
