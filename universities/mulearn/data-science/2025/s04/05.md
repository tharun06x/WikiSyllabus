## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Dataset Acquisition & Exploration
* Download the dataset from: [Bank Churn Dataset](https://datasets-8yqw.onrender.com/download/second)  
* Load the dataset and:
  * Generate **summary statistics**.
  * Explore data types, missing values, and class distribution.
  * Visualize important features and correlations.

---

### Module 2: Model Implementation
* Implement **Logistic Regression** using a suitable Python library (e.g., Scikit-learn).  
* Understand and document the **basic equation**:  
* Train the model and save predictions.

---

### Module 3: Model Evaluation & Output
* Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as:
  * Accuracy  
  * Precision  
  * Recall  
  * F1-Score  
  * ROC-AUC Score
* Interpret what each metric indicates about classification performance.  
* Create a **CSV file** containing:
  * Predicted labels (Churn/No Churn)
  * Corresponding original values

---

### Module 4: Documentation & Submission
* Include in your **GitHub README**:
  * Key insights with supporting graphs  
  * A short explanation of Logistic Regression and its working equation  
  * Interpretation of evaluation metrics  
* Host your repository and share the **GitHub link** for submission.
