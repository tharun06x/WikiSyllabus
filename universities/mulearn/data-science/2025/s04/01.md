## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Dataset Acquisition & Exploration
* Download the dataset from: [Real-World Prediction Dataset](https://datasets-8yqw.onrender.com/download/fiveone)  
* Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  * Visualize feature distributions.
  * Check correlations between variables.
  * Identify and handle missing values.

---

### Module 2: Data Preprocessing
* Clean the dataset (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale features).  
* Perform feature selection/engineering if necessary.  

---

### Module 3: Model Training & Optimization
* Train **multiple ML models** (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).  
* Tune hyperparameters to improve performance.  
* Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.  

---

### Module 4: Visualization & Reporting
* Create clear **graphs and charts** to present findings.  
* Summarize:
  * Data exploration results.
  * Chosen preprocessing techniques.
  * Model comparison and selection justification.
* Prepare a **short report or notebook summary**.

---

### Module 5: Documentation & Submission
* Include:
  * The implemented ML model code.
  * Visualizations and results.
  * A summary of approach, findings, and model choice justification.
* Host your project on **GitHub**.
* Share the repository link for submission.
