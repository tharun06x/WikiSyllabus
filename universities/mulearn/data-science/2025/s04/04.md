## Syllabus Modules

### Module 1: Dataset Acquisition & Exploration
* Download the dataset from: [House Price Dataset](https://datasets-8yqw.onrender.com/download/first)  
* Load the dataset and:
  * Generate **summary statistics**.
  * Explore data types, missing values, and distributions.
  * Visualize relevant features.

---

### Module 2: Model Implementation
* Implement **Linear Regression** using a suitable Python library (e.g., Scikit-learn).  
* Understand and document the **basic equation**:  
* Train the model and save predictions.

---

### Module 3: Model Evaluation & Output
* Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as:
  * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
  * Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  * R² Score
* Interpret what each metric indicates about the model’s accuracy.
* Create a **CSV file** containing:
  * Predicted house prices
  * Corresponding original values

---

### Module 4: Documentation & Submission
* Include in your **GitHub README**:
